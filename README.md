[00:10.11] Antes que se acabe la noche, serás mía
[00:16.14] Mi mente maquineando
[00:19.36] Ella con sus amigas, con la nota prendida
[00:25.12] Volando y yo pegándome
[00:36.12]

[01:14.83] Tráete tu cuerpo porque puedes
[01:17.27] Ella sabe, pero yo soy más listo
[01:19.36] Todo lo que subes por las redes
[01:21.76] No le doy like, pero sabe' que lo he visto
